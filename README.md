# ViaClaro

## Overview

The intricacies of career planning and job finding are quite daunting, especially for the newbies. Individuals often struggle with effectively planning their career trajectory and locating suitable job opportunities. Even though traditional career counselling is in place, it can be quite expensive, time-consuming, and may not provide personalized support. Therefore, we propose a Career Coach Chatbot named Via Claro (‘via’ meaning path and ‘claro’ meaning clear) that can assist users in defining a potential career path and in finding the right job opportunity.

This tool makes use of modern technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Large Language Models to provide personalized career advice based on users’ skills and interests. The chatbot will not only suggest potential career paths and available job opportunities based on the users’ skills but will also suggest an optimized road map to achieve the users’ career goals.
